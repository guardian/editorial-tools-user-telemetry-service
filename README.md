# editorial-tools-telemetry-service

A service to receive telemetry events and pass them on to a kinesis stream. Designed to be used across the Guardian's Editorial Tools to help the team gather data about tool usage.

Lambda code, event interface definitions and usage instructions to come.

## Creating the stack

In `/cdk`, run `npm i` to install dependencies, and `npm run synth` to generate cloudformation for the stack.
